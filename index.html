                <p class="sv-description">Hello! My name is Sinead Victory and I have been an educator in the Metro-Detroit area for six years.</p>
                <p class="sv-description">After receiving my bachelor’s degree in political science from Loyola University Chicago, I enrolled in the post-baccalaureate secondary education certification program at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. I student taught at Edsel Ford High School and became certified in Social Studies, History, and Political Science. I then spent my first year teaching at St. Paul on the Lake Catholic School before being hired in Dearborn Heights School District #7.</p>
                <p class="sv-description">In D7, I worked for four and a half years as a social studies teacher at Oakley W. Best Middle School. During this time, I also earned my master’s degree in education and instructional technology and my professional teaching license.</p>
                <p class="sv-description">In the winter of 2022, I switched roles within my district and was hired as Annapolis High School’s library media specialist. I am also currently enrolled in the Master of Library and Information Science program at Wayne State University. I am looking forward to learning more about this profession and cultivating my skills as a librarian.</p>

                <h1 class="phil-title">My Philosophy</h1>
                <p class="phil-description">I believe in the philosophy proposed by Dr. Bishop of librarianship encapsulated by the images of windows, mirrors, and sliding glass doors. This theory calls upon librarians to be both custodians of knowledge and advocates of diversity and inclusivity. My goal is to embody the values of intellectual freedom, equal access, and lifelong learning as I strive to create a welcoming environment where intellectual curiosity is nurtured, critical thinking is cultivated, and the joy of discovery is celebrated.</p>
                <p class="phil-description">I also feel that school librarians play a vital role in supporting and empowering teachers through cooperation and consultation. By actively engaging with teachers, librarians provide support in curriculum development, lesson planning, and the integration of information literacy skills into the classroom. Collaboration enables librarians to understand the unique needs of teachers and students, ensuring that resources and services are tailored to enhance learning outcomes.</p>
